ArthShastraAI üí∏
An advanced, multimodal financial assistant that leverages Generative AI for deep portfolio analysis, risk assessment, and intelligent Q&A. This tool empowers users to upload their portfolio data, receive comprehensive quantitative analysis, and get AI-driven advice for optimization.

üöÄ Core Features
Portfolio Optimizer Pro: Upload a CSV of historical asset prices to receive an in-depth analysis, including:

Automated data frequency detection (daily, weekly, monthly).

Comprehensive statistical summary tables.

Rich visualizations including cumulative returns, risk-return scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and rolling volatility charts.

Calculation and visualization of the Efficient Frontier with optimal portfolio compositions (Max Sharpe, Global Minimum Volatility).

Intelligent Q&A Assistant: An AI-powered chatbot that can answer financial questions. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide answers based on both its general knowledge and information from documents you upload.

Persistent Knowledge Base: Upload your own text documents (.txt, .md) to create a custom, persistent knowledge base. The AI assistant will use this information to provide more tailored answers.

üß† Key Concepts Implemented
This project stands at the intersection of quantitative finance and cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

Financial Engineering & Quantitative Analysis
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT): Core concepts are used to calculate and visualize the Efficient Frontier, allowing for the identification of optimal portfolios.

Risk & Return Metrics: Calculation of key performance indicators, including:

Sharpe Ratio: For risk-adjusted return.

Max Drawdown: To quantify potential downside risk.

Skewness & Kurtosis: To understand the shape and tail risk of the return distribution.

Value at Risk (VaR): Including the Cornish-Fisher VaR, which accounts for non-normal distributions.

Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR): To measure the expected shortfall in the tail of the distribution.

Time Series Analysis: Calculation of rolling volatility and cumulative returns to understand asset behavior over time.

Correlation Analysis: Generation of correlation matrices to assess diversification within the portfolio.

AI & NLP Concepts
Large Language Models (LLMs): Utilizes Google's Gemini model via LangChain for generating human-like analysis, summaries, and recommendations.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The Q&A system is built on a RAG architecture, which grounds the LLM's responses in specific, user-provided documents to reduce hallucinations and increase accuracy.

Sentence Embeddings: Employs advanced Transformer models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to convert text into meaningful vector representations for semantic understanding.

Tokenization: While handled implicitly by the embedding model, tokenization is a fundamental first step in the NLP pipeline used here to process all text inputs.

Vector Database: Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) as a high-speed, local vector store to index document embeddings and perform efficient similarity searches for the RAG system.

Prompt Engineering: Carefully crafted prompts are used to instruct the LLM on how to analyze financial data and structure its advice professionally.

Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.10 or higher

Git

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/dhavalkhandelwal/ArthShastraAI.git
cd ArthShastraAI
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
On Windows:

Bash

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Your API Key
Open the app.py file in a code editor.

Find the following line:

Python

GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
Replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual Google Gemini API key.


5. Run the Application
Bash

streamlit run app.py
The application should now be open and running in your web browser!

üìñ Usage
Portfolio Optimizer Pro: Navigate to this mode and upload the provided comprehensive_portfolio.csv or your own CSV file containing historical price data. The app will automatically guide you through the analysis.

Upload Knowledge (RAG): Go to this mode to upload .txt or .md files. This will add them to the AI's knowledge base.

Ask Anything (Q&A): Use this chat interface to ask general financial questions or questions specifically about the documents you've uploaded.
